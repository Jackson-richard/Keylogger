# Keystroke Logging (Keylogger)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Keystroke Logging (Keylogger) project is an educational application developed to understand how keyboard input events are captured and processed at the system level. This project is intended strictly for academic learning and ethical use.

It demonstrates event-driven programming concepts and helps students explore basic system monitoring techniques in a controlled environment.
